# Sales-Report
I went to a small business in my neighbourhood and offered my knowledge in Excel and Power BI. I also offered them a freelancing work by creating Excel charts so the manager and owner could monitor the sales of his five stores.
Five worksheets that include weekly sales, categorization sales, and labour expenditures were created; they also show the percentages of each categorical variable and are automatically updated in response to changes in sales. I also created a final worksheet that would sum up the sales from all 5 shops and allow them to see and manage sales and make futuristic decisions.
